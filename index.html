                        <li>
                            3 ounces/85 grams bittersweet chocolate, 70 to 74
                            percent cacao (not chips), chopped (about 1/2 cup)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus
                            more for the ramekin
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            3 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus more for the
                            ramekin
                        </li>
                        <li>1 large egg</li>
                        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>pinch of salt</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Heat oven to 425 degrees and butter a 10-ounce
                            ramekin. Dust the buttered ramekin with granulated
                            sugar.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Combine the chocolate and 3 tablespoons butter in a
                            heat-safe bowl set over a pan of simmering water.
                            Cook, stirring occasionally, until melted and
                            smooth. (Alternatively, combine in a bowl and
                            microwave in 30-second blasts, stirring in between,
                            until melted and smooth, about 1 minute.) Remove
                            from the heat and set aside.

                        <li>
                            In a medium bowl, combine the 3 tablespoons sugar,
                            egg, egg yolk, vanilla and salt. Whisk vigorously
                            until the mixture is thick, foamy and pale, about 2
                            minutes. Whisk in the flour until smooth.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using a spatula, add the chocolate to the egg
                            mixture and stir gently until combined.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pour the mixture into the ramekin. Bake for 12 to 14
                            minutes or until the edges are set and puffed, but
                            the center is still soft when lightly pressed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use an offset spatula or small knife to loosen the
                            edges of the cake from the ramekin. Place a plate
                            over the ramekin and carefully invert the warm cake.
                            Use an oven mitt or clean kitchen towel to remove
                            the ramekin, dust the cake with confectioners' sugar
                            and serve with ice cream or whipped cream.
